"i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .',"
" some things that i did nt like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).',"
" main dial is not backlit . ',"
"canon g3 ? incredible camera',"
 still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
" the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features .',"
"It was bad and utter waste',"
"i ve figured out most of its features on my own already ',"
" excellent for the semi-serious amateur',"
" its focusing system is also very flexible .',"
"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .',"
" quite bulky and uses a heavy battery',"
" fantastic digital camera ',"
" the camera has a wonderful set of features .',"
" you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . ',"
"the best of everything ',"
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . 
"i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb ."
"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it ."
"if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for . "
i highly recommend it .
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
ok for a digital camera
"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . "
the grain was terrible
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
