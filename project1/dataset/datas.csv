does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ? 
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ? 
"before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first . "
no picture : 
hopefully you still have the remote control . 
"if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it . "
"using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . "
the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive . 
"if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd . "
"if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car ! "
picture scrolling in b/w : 
you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard . 
press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . 
the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
